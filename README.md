  ## Description 
  
  ```md
  I created a tech  blog using an MVC framework. For the client side I used Handlebars.js, css and Javascript.
  I created a mysql database. I connected the client side and the back end using express and routing via 
  (get, post, put and delete). I deployed the app using Heroku.

  ## About

  It's a Tech Blog, on the homepage you can view posts, comment on post if you are logged in,

  dashboard where you can create post of your own or delete or edit existing post that you have created.
